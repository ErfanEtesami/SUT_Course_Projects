# Course Projects of my Bachelor's Studies

This repository contains some of my course projects during my bachelor's studies at Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.<br>

The reports of these course projects are only avaibale in Farsi; however, based on the title of courses and projects, you may find the codes helpful.
A brief summary is provided below.<br>

## Applied Electronics
This project was about making an automatic laser gun with a servomotor, a Keyes laser diode, an ultrasonic sensor, and an IR proximity sensor
using Arduino Uno Microcontroller.

## Dynamics of Machinery
Implementation of 6-bar rock crusher and cam follower mechanisms for a fuel valve in a car engine using MATLAB & Simulink.

## Fundamentals of Automatic Controller Design - Ball and Beam Project
Controlling a ball-and-beam model using PID controllers.

## Fundamentals of Automatic Controller Design - Codes
